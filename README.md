# Exercise: Basic Authentication and Authorization Configuration - Angular

This Angular application consumes an [API](https://github.com/leticiaborchardt/TA-exercicio-auth) and applies authentication and authorization logic by accessing the login, logout, get appointments, and post appointments endpoints.

The permission validation for appointments occurs as follows:

- POST -> roles: admin, doctor, and receptionist
- GET -> roles: admin, doctor, and patient
